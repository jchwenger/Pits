A collection of some sources / people I came across who use computation for textual ends.

**Nick Montfort**

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nickmofo)  

A professor of digital media at MIT, he published books of computational literature and poetry, as well as studies and collections. (His [page at MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/nick-montfort)).

**Allison Parish**

- [Github](https://github.com/aparrish?tab=repositories)  

A poet and programmer who is also professor at the ITPY in New York University. She published books of computational poetry, and is also active online (Twitter bots, Tumblr, websites...). Her recent works include explorations of Word2Vec embedding models, the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict). I also found useful resources on Python, bash text tools on her website.

**Ross Goodwin**

- [Website](http://rossgoodwin.com/)  
- [Articles on Medium](https://medium.com/@rossgoodwin)  
- [Github](https://github.com/rossgoodwin?tab=repositories)  

Self-proclaimedly 'not a poet', he studied at the ITP at NYU and continues working with text, and text-&-image, text-&-film interfaces ([a few details here](https://medium.com/artists-and-machine-intelligence/adventures-in-narrated-reality-6516ff395ba3)). He also talks about a collaboration with the Google Deep Dream VR experience with regards to poetic voiceovers (in the same article). He mentions Allison Parish as a mentor and influence, and works with Markov chains and, now probably almost exclusively, with Deep Neural Nets. His film script 'Sunspring', developed using the latter, has had quite an impact (see [his second article](https://medium.com/artists-and-machine-intelligence/adventures-in-narrated-reality-part-ii-dc585af054cb)).

Cited by Rebecca Fiebrink in her machine learning class, she uses neural networks to create new words, names or phrases that she then posts on her website.

**Max Woolf**

- [Tiwtter](https://twitter.com/minimaxir)
- [Github](https://github.com/minimaxir)

A data scientist who developed a library for RNN text generation in Python, [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn), that is most likely going to be useful in the future, both for text generation and for learning the ins and outs of these networks.
