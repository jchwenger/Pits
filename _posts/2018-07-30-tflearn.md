Slow, and rather painstaking advances in [Parag Mital's course on Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow/info) and [associated repo](https://github.com/pkmital/CADL)... TensorFlow really is verbose. I imagine one must be happy to have all these options when mastering the whole thing, but it does make the learning process more difficult. Another thing that comes to mind: as often happens, visual arts and music take the lion's share in the computational arts business, and unsurprisingly Mital's course focuses on that (although I noticed that [there is a textual model hidden deep in the repo](https://github.com/pkmital/pycadl/blob/577931dfffdd7cecbcb565c84a470aca12d2b214/cadl/charrnn.py), to be studied in due course). 

While looking for simpler paths of entry into the TensorFlow library (and given my current progress I'd probably stick with it rather than try and learn [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [Keras](https://keras.io/)), I came across another source for learning: [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/), a high-level library built on top of TensorFlow, meant to make access to it lighter without removing the possibility to dig deeper if need be. 

The examples for text generation that I intend to work with can be found [here](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn/blob/master/examples/nlp/lstm_generator_cityname.py) and [there](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn/blob/master/examples/nlp/lstm_generator_shakespeare.py).
