The WordSquares conundrum did make me think about speed and optimisation. Friends in the field do confirm that C++ (& C), Java, and in general compiled (instead of [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) ones like Python) are much faster. The [Cython library](http://cython.org/) has been built to provide Python with C-like speed capabilities (by adding strong typing and, if you so desire, integrate loops into the C compiler, which greatly improve efficiency). Definitely a project for the future!

The video also includes a part on [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/multiprocessing.html), which I already treated [here]({{ site.basurl }}{% post_url /lore/2018-07-02-multiprocessing %}).
