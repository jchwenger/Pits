After weeks of stagnation at the end of session 2 of [Parag Mital's course on Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow/info), some progress, but only until half of session 4, dealing with the nitty-gritty of [Variational Autoencoders](http://kvfrans.com/variational-autoencoders-explained/)... Steep, but after setting myself to copy every single line of code in these Jupyter Notebooks, the whole verbosity of TensorFlow becomes a little less alien.

I should mention that all this learning has been made far more possible after having followed [Rebecca Fiebrink](https://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas01rf/homepage/)'s courses at Goldsmiths and her [Machine Learning for Musicians and Artists on Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/machine-learning-for-musicians-and-artists/info). That offered a first basis for the work at hand.

One of the main issues I encounter is that I don't manage to find a direct application, or a direct way of implementing, my own projects, using these techniques. I am learning them, slowly, but in the abstract, as it were. These attempts still remain dsconnected from actual artistic practice. This is reinforced by the heavy focus on visuals (and, to a lesser extent, music and performance) in most of what I see around in the 'neural art' scene. 

Still, the use of [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) for artistic practice is promising, and it would be good to be able to apply that to text. Mital is collaborating with [Refik Anadol](http://refikanadol.com/) on GAN-generated music and animation at the moment, see [this](https://twitter.com/refikanadol/status/1024175473192923138) and [that](https://twitter.com/pkmital/status/1022703840641003521) tweet for instance, as well as the following video:
