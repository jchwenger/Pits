Recursus is a bit of a monster. Two of its arms, WordSquares and Subwords, are quite similar in scope and nature. Yet including only those would not have been satisfactory. Rather early on in my [Oulipo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo)-inspired research into words and letter constraints I felt I was hitting a wall, albeit perhaps an internal one. The conclusion that my approach using these constraints is not free enough. It does foster practice, which had been somewhat flailing beforehand, but it corners me into finding word combinations, extremely constrained lexical clusters, the evocative powers of which I am then set to maximize. This leads to asyntactic poetics, where the poetic, literary space exists in the combined meanings of the words, without almost any regards to their arrangement. This works to some extent, and I manage to *dream* these spaces, if the words are well-chosen enough. However the drive, the urge for syntax, for more than a crafted complex of words, remains, and often I find myself trying to find primitive sentences, or phrases, within the squares or subword decompositions I am examining. AIT is the missing piece, the fledgling link to a restored sense of linearity and development. On its own, it would have been computationally much weaker. Despite my efforts in gathering knowledge of machine learning, and deep learning in particular, reaching a sense of mastery and ease when developing a creative framework remains elusive. From my experience, this is the typical symptom of a phase of assimilation. Seemingly no light at the end of the tunnel, despite active boring, until unexpected advances and familiarity kick in, and code, like writing perhaps, comes to the fingers. The creative interaction with the product of neural text generation is also closer to literary practice as commonly understood, which is an alleyway I am set to explore in the future. Recursus, thus, as its name suggests, is both a return (to literary practice: writing, editing, imagination with constraints) as well as a step forward, the transition from a more straightforward, perhaps classical approach of computational literature (where the element of computation might have an overbearing importance on the finished pieces), to a less defined, but hopefully more fertile ground of symbiosis between the writing and the machine.

I will not go into a detailed discussion of Subwords, as the process is the same as with WordSquares, but without the difficulties I encountered with the latter. To my surprise, evocative, interesting subword decompositions were easy, rather than hard, to find, and the batches shown are only a few of the possibilities present in the databases generated so far. Unlike with WordSquares, I had to stop searching and arbitrarily decide, given the time at hand, that I had to leave other possibilities to future research. Instead, I will focus on the two antagonistic practices developed here: 
- WordSquares, where constraint levels are extremely high (due to vast numbers of results with looser ones)
- AIT, which offers new forms of constraints, a new balance in my interaction with them.

The core impediment, and quite a discovery, is that
