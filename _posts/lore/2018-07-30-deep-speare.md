One more (usual?) attempt at making a network write Shakespeare sonnets. As usual, the results are semi-sensical (and not poetically overwhelming). Upside: they got the pentameters right!

- The [New Scientist article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2175301-ai-creates-shakespearean-sonnets-and-theyre-actually-quite-good/); 
- The [paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03491.pdf).

More of the same:

- A [Github repo for Neural Shakneration](https://github.com/burliEnterprises/tensorflow-shakespeare-poem-generator/blob/master/README.md); 
- Said repo points to [this other repo](https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare); 
- And the [article on Medium on music & text generation with TensorFlow](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-with-tensorflow-part-3-music-and-text-generation-8a3fbfdc5e9b).
