Batch III from Subwords. Words from [litscape](https://www.litscape.com/).

Deterritorialisation: "Deterritorialization (French: déterritorialisation) is a concept created by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in Anti-Oedipus (1972). The term "deterritorialization" first occurs in French psychoanalytic theory to refer, broadly, to the fluid, dissipated and schizophrenic nature of human subjectivity in contemporary capitalist cultures (Deleuze & Guattari 1972)." (Wikipedia)  
Erasion: n. "The action of erasing." (OED)  
Tertia: n. "A division of infantry: see quot. 1870; a tercio n.; a regiment; also transf." (OED)
