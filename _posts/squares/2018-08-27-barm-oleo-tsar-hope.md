Obsolete.", "Any mixture of many heterogeneous elements; a hotchpotch, medley, jumble. Frequently with of." or "A collection of various artistic or literary pieces, a book containing miscellaneous items (such as engravings, or poems) on various subjects.", but why not also "Relating to, employing, or designating a kind of telescopic strut used esp. in aircraft undercarriages, which absorbs shocks by means of a hollow piston into which oil is forced through a small orifice on compression of the strut (see also quot. 1965)."

Blae: adj. & n. "Of a dark colour between black and blue; blackish blue; of the colour of the blae-berry ( Vaccinium myrtillus); livid; also, of a lighter shade, bluish grey, lead-coloured.
