Recursus, Latin: a “return”, a “retreat”, but also “the power to bring back an image” (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=recursus">Perseus</a>). Excursus: a “detailed discussion” or a “digression” (<a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/excursus">Oxford</a>). Recursion: “the repeated application of a recursive procedure or definition” (<a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/recursion">Oxford</a>). Lastly, curse: those issues, forms, words, that come back to haunt, doom and delight. This modular, metastatic project of computational literature currently contains ‘<a href="https://github.com/jchwenger/WordSquares">WordSquares</a>’, squares of letters where rows, columns and diagonals are words; ‘<a href="https://github.com/jchwenger/Subwords">Subwords</a>’, decompositions of (longer) words into splintered, shorter subwords, with no letter left unaccounted for; and ‘<a href="https://github.com/jchwenger/AIT">AIT</a>’, inchoate steps into neural text generation, based on [yet to be unearthed series of texts known as ‘it I-VI’](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ftu3e1trzhje59w/AAD_9SkrV3iF80uIXBPFbbnZa?dl=0).

This site contains the thoughts and meanders that arose in the process of elaboration of these pieces, during the Summer term of 2018 of the <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-computational-arts/">MA of Computational Arts</a> at Goldsmiths College, London.
